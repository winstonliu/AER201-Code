To use the submodule in ball_manipulation/lib/Grove_LCD run:

git submodule update

When you want to switch branches, create an empty branch and checkout that first. Remove everything remaining. ie,

git checkout empty
rm -rf *

And then proceed to checkout whatever branch suits your fancy.

There's probably a better way to do this on newer versions of git.
